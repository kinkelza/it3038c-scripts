# Project3
This Project was created for It3038C. This is a basic calculator that is can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, divison and square numbers. This was built using python. This project can be run on any system that has python installed. The program first asks what math the user wants to perform. The user will enter + for addition, - for subtraction, * for multiplication, / for division, ^ to perform a square and put in q to quit. After the user picks the type of math they want to perform, it will ask how many numbers they want to add/subtract/multiply/divide. The square only allows 1 number and will export the square of the number. Once they User inputs there selection, the code will run and ask for each number and then output the answer.
This project uses the tkinter python module and creates a GUI to input numbers and outputs the answers inside of a GUI box rather then the terminal on a system.
